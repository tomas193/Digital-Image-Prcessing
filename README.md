# Digital Image Processing

## Overview
Digital image processing involves the use of computer algorithms to perform operations on digital images to enhance, analyze, or manipulate them. This field plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications, including medical imaging, remote sensing, photography, and computer vision. By converting images into digital data, various techniques such as filtering, segmentation, and compression can be applied to improve image quality, extract useful information, or reduce the file size for storage and transmission. The flexibility and power of digital image processing make it an essential tool in both scientific research and everyday technology. Digital image processing with Python has become increasingly popular due to the language's versatility and the availability of powerful libraries. Python offers tools like OpenCV, Pillow, and scikit-image, which simplify tasks such as image filtering, transformation, enhancement, and analysis. These libraries provide easy-to-use functions for complex operations, enabling users to manipulate images, detect edges, apply filters, and even perform advanced tasks like object recognition and segmentation. This repository contains image processing with python.
